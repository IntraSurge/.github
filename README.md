The **IntraSurge** project is an innovative research initiative focused on advancing surgical procedures through intelligent, AI-driven guidance systems. Our aim is to enhance intraoperative anatomy recognition, support surgeons in real time, prevent unnecessary tissue injury, and ultimately improve patient safety.

### Funding and Collaboration

This project is proudly funded by the [Dutch Research Council (NWO)](https://www.nwo.nl/en/projects/kich1st0321019) and the [Hanarth Fonds](https://www.hanarthfonds.nl/en/en-granted-applications/en-2022-call/en-jelle-ruurda), and involves close collaboration with esteemed academic institutions including Eindhoven University of Technology, University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU), and Utrecht University. UMCU is a leading center for robotic-assisted esophagectomy and maintains a comprehensive database of monocular and stereoscopic surgical video footage. We also collaborate with industry partners [Rods&Cones](https://rods-cones.com/) and [Asensus Surgical](https://www.asensus.com/).


### Research Focus

Our current research interests include:

- **Video-based anatomical segmentation**
- **Surgical phase recognition**
- **Surgical foundation models**
- **Vision-language modeling**
- **3D-3D registration**: Aligning preoperative CT scans with intraoperative video
- **Depth estimation & SLAM**
- **Clinical value validation**

These efforts are designed to push the boundaries of computer-aided surgery and deliver tangible benefits to both clinicians and patients.
